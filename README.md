Cypress Basic Tests

This repository contains a simple Cypress automation project created to demonstrate foundational end-to-end testing skills.
It includes:

1. A clean Cypress folder structure

2. Example E2E tests

3. Basic UI interactions and assertions

More tests and improvements will be added soon as I expand my QA automation portfolio, including structured frameworks, API tests, and CI integration.
