📌 Folder Description

basics/ – Local UI interaction tests for core Cypress skills: form validation, inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, link navigation; useful for selectors, command chaining, assertions, and UI behavior.

cart/ – Full cart functionality tests: add single/multiple products, remove products, badge verification, cart count, multi-product scenarios using Page Object Model.

real_site/ – Full E2E test flow on SauceDemo: login workflow, product listing validation, add-to-cart flow, multi-page user journey, UI assertions across pages.

pages/ – Page Object Model (POM): centralized locators, reusable UI actions, cleaner test files, easier maintainability.

smoke/ – Fast, critical-path tests for quick build verification.

regression/ – Full regression suite to validate complete product functionality.

fixtures/ – Local HTML files and JSON data for the basics tests.

support/ – Global setup: reusable Cypress commands, before/after hooks, shared utilities for test stability.

⚡ How to Run Tests

Aprire Cypress GUI (modalità interattiva):
npm run cypress:open

Eseguire tutti i test headless:
npm run cypress:run

Eseguire uno specifico spec:
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/cart/add_product_cart_multiple.cy.js"

I report HTML e JSON vengono generati automaticamente in cypress/reports/ e gli screenshot in cypress/screenshots/**/*.png.
